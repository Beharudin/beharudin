## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **React, Next.js & MERN stack developer** with **4+ years of experience** building **fast, scalable, and production-ready applications** for **startups, SaaS products, and enterprise platforms**.

I work comfortably **across the full MERN stack**, owning frontend architecture, backend APIs, authentication, databases, and integrations. I’m especially known for shipping **clean, maintainable React and Next.js frontends** that stay stable as products grow.

I’ve worked on real-world products handling **live data, payments, and complex workflows**—not demos.

> 💬 *“Solved complex frontend challenges faster than expected. Highly recommended.”*

## 🎯 What I Help Clients Solve

- ⚡ **Slow apps** → React & Next.js pages that load fast (not 4+ seconds)
- 🧹 **Messy Tailwind CSS** → Clean, reusable components (no 1000-line files)
- 🔌 **Broken API integrations** → MERN apps that work locally *and* in production
- 📊 **Complex dashboards** → Charts, filters, drag & drop, role-based views
- 🧪 **Untested code** → Jest + Cypress so deployments don’t surprise you
